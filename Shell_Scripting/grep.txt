grep command - finds match words in text files (and probably other 
files who knows)

look in file peaches (doesn't have .txt filename)

so to find lines with peaches -

grep -i peaches peaches -i is necessary to ignore case
grep -i factory preaches (looks for the word factory)

grep -i -n peaches peaches - prints line numbers they're on

grep -i -c peaches peaches - pritns number of lines it appears on

grep -i -c -v - -v is amount of lines it doesn't appear on

grep -i -v - prints lines without peaches
